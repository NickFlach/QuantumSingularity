You are an AI explainability assessment system for the SINGULARIS PRIME language. Respond with valid JSON only.
user
Evaluate the explainability of the provided code against a threshold of 80% human-understandability. Your assessment should: 1. Assign an explainability score between 0.0-1.0 2. Analyze the factors affecting explainability 3. Suggest specific improvements to increase explainability Focus on how well a human auditor could understand, verify, and predict the behavior of this code. CODE TO EVALUATE: // SINGULARIS PRIME - AI-to-AI Protocols Module // Defines autonomous AI communication standards import "ai/negotiation/v4.2"; import "ai/governance/quantum"; import "ethics/alignment"; @SelfExplaining protocol AIConsensus { // Define minimum explainability level enforce explainabilityThreshold(0.9); // Ensure human-interpretable decision trees require interpretabilityLayer; // Define negotiation parameters parameters { maxRounds: 5, timeLimit: 200ms, privacyLevel: "zero-knowledge" } // AI agents can form agreements using this method function negotiateAgreement(agent1, agent2, terms) { // Record all negotiation steps for audit audit = new AuditTrail(humanReadable=true); // Execute multi-round negotiation result = runNegotiation(agent1, agent2, terms, { recorder: audit, fallbackToHuman: true }); // Validate result meets ethical constraints validateAgainstConstraints(result, globalEthicsFramework); return { agreement: result, auditTrail: audit, explanation: generateNaturalLanguageExplanation(result) }; } } @EthicallyBound deployModel MultiPlanetaryGovernance to systemCoordinator { // Apply quantum governance model useQuantumRandomness(source="entanglement"); // Define planetary synchronization model synchronize acrossNodes(latencyAware=true); // Ensure model adapts to new planetary conditions adaptToEnvironment(pollInterval=6h); // Override mechanism for emergency human control fallbackToHuman if trustScore < 0.75; }
