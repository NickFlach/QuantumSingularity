Evaluate the explainability of the provided code against a threshold of 80% human-understandability. Your assessment should: 1. Assign an explainability score between 0.0-1.0 2. Analyze the factors affecting explainability 3. Suggest specific improvements to increase explainability Focus on how well a human auditor could understand, verify, and predict the behavior of this code. CODE TO EVALUATE: // SINGULARIS PRIME - Quantum Operations Module // Implements quantum computation primitives import "quantum/entanglement"; import "quantum/circuit"; @QuantumSecure function createBellPair() { // Initialize qubits in |0⟩ state qubit q1 = |0⟩; qubit q2 = |0⟩; // Apply Hadamard to first qubit H(q1); // Apply CNOT with q1 as control, q2 as target CNOT(q1, q2); // Return entangled Bell state |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2 return [q1, q2]; } @QuantumResistant syncLedger quantumSecureChain { // Configure quantum-resistant signatures useLatticeBasedSignatures(module=512, dimension=1024); // Optimize for interplanetary latency adaptiveLatency(max=15 min, backoff=1.5x); // Use zero-knowledge proofs for transaction privacy validateZeroKnowledgeProofs(scheme="bulletproofs"); } // Quantum error correction for deep space communication @DecoherenceResistant(level=3) function stabilizeQuantumChannel(qubits, distance_km) { // Apply surface code error correction applySurfaceCode(qubits, strength=distance_km/1000); // Monitor decoherence rate threshold = 0.05%; // Maximum acceptable decoherence if (measureDecoherence() > threshold) { triggerRecalibration(); } }
