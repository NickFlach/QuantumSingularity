Evaluate the explainability of the provided code against a threshold of 80% human-understandability. Your assessment should: 1. Assign an explainability score between 0.0-1.0 2. Analyze the factors affecting explainability 3. Suggest specific improvements to increase explainability Focus on how well a human auditor could understand, verify, and predict the behavior of this code. CODE TO EVALUATE: // SINGULARIS PRIME - Main Program import "quantum/entanglement"; import "ai/negotiation/v4.2"; @QuantumSecure quantumKey secureKey = entangle(sender, receiver); @HumanAuditable(0.85) contract AIContract { enforce explainabilityThreshold(0.85); require secureKey; execute consensusProtocol(epoch=501292); }

    "negative_factors": [
      "The function 'entangle(sender, receiver)' is not defined within this snippet, making it unclear what specific operations are performed to create 'secureKey'.",
      "The 'execute consensusProtocol(epoch=501292)' lacks details on what the consensus protocol involves, making it hard to predict its behavior or verify its correctness.",
      "The 'enforce explainabilityThreshold(0.85)' suggests a requirement for explainability, but the code does not provide any mechanisms or outputs that demonstrate compliance with this threshold."

    "Provide documentation or comments explaining the purpose and functionality of 'entangle' and 'consensusProtocol'.",
