Evaluate the explainability of the provided code against a threshold of 80% human-understandability. Your assessment should: 1. Assign an explainability score between 0.0-1.0 2. Analyze the factors affecting explainability 3. Suggest specific improvements to increase explainability Focus on how well a human auditor could understand, verify, and predict the behavior of this code. CODE TO EVALUATE: // SINGULARIS PRIME - Main Program import "quantum/entanglement"; import "ai/negotiation/v4.2"; @QuantumSecure quantumKey secureKey = entangle(sender, receiver); @HumanAuditable(0.85) contract AIContract { enforce explainabilityThreshold(0.85); require secureKey; execute consensusProtocol(epoch=501292); }
