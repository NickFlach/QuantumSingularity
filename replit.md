# SINGULARIS PRIME - Quantum-Secure AI-Native Programming Language

## Overview

SINGULARIS PRIME is an experimental quantum-secure, AI-native programming language designed for human-auditable AI systems. The project combines quantum computing principles, AI governance mechanisms, and interplanetary communication protocols into a unified development environment. It features a full-stack web application with React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database, implementing advanced quantum simulation capabilities, high-dimensional quantum states (37-dimensional qudits), quantum magnetism modeling, and AI explainability frameworks. The system includes a ceremonial DSL called G.L.Y.P.H. (Generalized Lattice Yield Protocolic Hieroglyphs) for ritual-based quantum programming and mathematical frameworks based on Kashiwara Genesis for formal reasoning.

## User Preferences
